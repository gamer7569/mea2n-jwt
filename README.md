# MEA2N + User Auth with JWT

A simple MEAN stack using Angular 2, with built-in auth using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). 

## Usage

Simply `npm install` your dependencies, then run `npm start`. This starts a local server, launches pm2, and builds out the Angular 2 dist folder. In your browser, go to localhost:3000 to see the app. Changes will be live-reloaded in your browser.
